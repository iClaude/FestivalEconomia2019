This is an Android app dedicated to the "**Festival dell'Economia 2019**" (Economy Festival 2019) held every year in Trento (Italy), an important event attracting distinguished speakers from all over the world, including **Nobel prizes**, famous economists and important politicians.

The Economy festival has been brought into being in 2006 in order to enable and facilitate discussions between economists and a broad public. The ultimate ambition of this festival is to put the economic terminology across to everyone. The Festival dellâ€™Economia di Trento takes place every year at the end of May on the historic Palazzi of the old town in Trento.
