RAI has a relatively high television audience share of 33.8%. \nRAI broadcasts are also received in neighbouring countries, including Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, Slovenia, Vatican City, Switzerland, and Tunisia, and elsewhere on pay television. Sometimes Rai 1 was received even further in Europe via Sporadic E until the digital switch off in July 2012. \nHalf of the RAI's revenues come from broadcast receiving licence fees, the rest from the sale of advertising time. In 1950, the RAI became one of the 23 founding broadcasting organizations of the European Broadcasting Union.",

The decor was inspired by the movements of the Mitteleuropa aesthetics, born in the mid-nineteenth century, which had their maximum and most mature expression in the first two decades of the twentieth century, particularly the Secession of Vienna.

In 1835 the entrepreneur-coffee maker sold the property and the Theater changed its name to Teatro Sociale, run by the Theater Company.

But Lint can do even more for advanced users. Come to this demo-heavy talk to learn about the less common uses of Lint, which may include: \n\n - Writing custom Lint checks for domain- or team-specific needs\n - Using annotations to catch threading bugs *before* they cause UI freezes\n - Enabling off-by-default checks to improve Java/Kotlin interoperability\n - Performance best practices when running Lint on a CI server\n",
