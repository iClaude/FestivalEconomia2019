RAI has a relatively high television audience share of 33.8%. \nRAI broadcasts are also received in neighbouring countries, including Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, Slovenia, Vatican City, Switzerland, and Tunisia, and elsewhere on pay television. Sometimes Rai 1 was received even further in Europe via Sporadic E until the digital switch off in July 2012. \nHalf of the RAI's revenues come from broadcast receiving licence fees, the rest from the sale of advertising time. In 1950, the RAI became one of the 23 founding broadcasting organizations of the European Broadcasting Union.",

The decor was inspired by the movements of the Mitteleuropa aesthetics, born in the mid-nineteenth century, which had their maximum and most mature expression in the first two decades of the twentieth century, particularly the Secession of Vienna.

The theater was called Teatro Mazzurana, named after Felice Mazzurana, promoter of the construction and first owner. In 1835 the entrepreneur-coffee maker sold the property and the Theater changed its name to Teatro Sociale, run by the Theater Company.

The project was drafted by a Viennese architect who conceived a dome-shaped roof supported by arches made of fine wooden trellis (1912).

      "description": "James Robinson\nintroduced by Tito Boeri\n\nThe specter of populism is haunting the world. But what is it exactly? Where does it come from and what should be done about it? We define populism as an anti-elitist exclusionary political strategy which builds a coalition of discontented citizens to challenge the status-quo. To understand why this coalition is potentially destabilizing to democracy and how it forms we developed a framework to studying the joint evolution of state and society.",

Our results are a first step towards understanding cultural backlash as a channel of transmission of radical right support, which has been traditionally difficult to study and which we can address in the appropriate way using new data and techniques.",

      "description": "Marco Tabellini\nintroduced by Nunzia Penelope\n\nThe recent rise in immigration has sparked a heated debate on its economic and social consequences. Support for right wing and anti-establishment parties, which tend to rely on a strongly anti-immigrant rhetoric, has grown astonishingly in almost every European country and in the US over the last decade. In this lecture, I focus on the first three decades of the 20th century, when millions of European immigrants moved to the United States, during the Age of Mass Migration. The first part of the lecture studies the political and economy impact of immigration in receiving cities, and explores the causes of natives’ backlash. It shows that political opposition to immigration can arise even when immigrants bring economic prosperity. These findings suggest that diversity might be economically desirable but politically hard to manage. The second part of the lecture investigates the factors that help or hinder the cultural assimilation of immigrants. In particular, it discusses how the inflow of new (ethnic and social) out-groups can influence the social inclusion of previous outsiders, and how the size of immigrant enclaves mediates their ability and their willingness to assimilate.",

These include technological change, a demand shift, bad management, and three kinds of international outsourcing. Demand for import protection increases significantly in all cases, except for the “bad management” shock. Effects appear to be heterogeneous across subgroups with different political preferences and education. Trump supporters are more protectionist than Clinton supporters, but preferences seem easy to manipulate: Clinton supporters primed with trade shocks are as protectionist as baseline Trump voters. Highlighting labor abuses in the exporting country increases the demand for trade protection by Clinton supporters but not Trump supporters.",

Rather, they emerge from the involvement of society in politics in a way that balances the power of state institutions and elites. This precarious balance, when it is achieved, unleashes a powerful process of building of state capacity and development of society's capability to institutionalize its involvement in politics. The corridor leading to such institutions is narrow because of the difficulty of creating this balance and staying the course despite myriad conflicts and gridlocks.\n\nDaron Acemoglu via video link discusses with Antonio Spilimbergo",

      "description": "Annalisa Camilli - Graham Ellis - Nicola Pifferi - Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli\ncoordinated by Eric Jozsef\nspeaker: Andrea Fracasso\n\nWithout public support at European level it is difficult to imagine political union. To create it, exchanges between national media are necessary, along with the creation of places for the exchange of transnational information, analysis and discussion. There is a new generation that considers itself European and seeks critical and selected information. Antonio Megalizzi a young Italian reporter tragically killed in the December terrorist attacks in Strasburg, belonged to this generation.",

      "description": "John Ralston Saul\nSince 2008 we have been paying for the refusal of Western elites to deal with their own failures. Now we witness a defensive explosion in the population who have been literally forced by the mainstream elites to turn to irresponsible leaders. All sides have forgotten that the source of legitimacy in any democracy is the citizenry. Maintenance of that legitimacy depends critically on citizen engagement in the public good - not ripping it down, but building it in an inclusive and empathetic way.",

Technological innovation has presumably led to a substantial change in the economic and social mechanisms that generate growth and democracy. The behaviour of two very different countries such as China and Italy can act as a starting point for a useful reflection.",

The structural transformation required to reduce carbon emissions in line with the IPCC target is profound, and, as will be argued, cannot be left to markets, private initiative and/or pecuniary nudges. A green industrial policy might accomplish this, but it will have to overcome powerful tendencies towards dual economies in the world’s most advanced economies.",

Some 87 per cent of UNHCR staff work in the field, often in difficult and dangerous duty stations. The organization's needs-based budget for 2018 is US$7.5 billion.\nBefore being elected High Commissioner, he had been engaged in international cooperation for over 30 years, focusing on refugee and humanitarian work. He served as Commissioner-General of the UN Agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, from 2010 to 2014, after having been the organization’s Deputy Commissioner-General since 2005. Prior to that, he served as Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in Afghanistan, following a long career first with NGOs and later with UNHCR in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and at the organization’s Geneva headquarters.

Following his election as Speaker of the House he resigned his political affiliation and left the Conservative Party. He has been a reformist Speaker, seeking to interest and involve citizens in what is happening in Parliament. In line with modern times, he has abandoned the traditional dress of the Speaker of the House, in particular the wig, adopting only a formal black suit and tie. He tries above all to increase the influence and independence of the House from the cabinet. Far more than his predecessors, he has allowed members to request the presence of Ministers at debates and obliged Ministers to attend the House in order to answer questions from Members of Parliament.",
